# Problem statement
Write a ROS node (Python or C++) for a differential drive robot in an unknown environment to implement the following trajectory:
![image](./images/robot_path.png)

### Note:
• Assume that the robot is using navigation stack of ROS. <br/>
• The robot must begin and end its path in the given orientations.<br/>
• Use move_base package to achieve the above solution.<br/>
• Configure all the parameters of move_base required for path planning and obstacle avoidance.<br/>
• Send us the written node along with the configuration files for move_base.<br/>
• Also attach a short report (not more than one page) briefly explaining your approach towards the solution.
